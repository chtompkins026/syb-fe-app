            <h2> Who We Are </h2>
              <p> Here at SurfYogaBeer, we create fitness adventures worldwide that
                connect people from all over the world through a mutual love of surf yoga,
                and our personal favorite: beer. We get our sweat in with workouts
                designed to take advantage of the environments that we explore.
                The nights following are filled with stories your future grandkids
                will get sick of hearing, new friends that bring out your most
                adventurous self, and maybe the one-beer-too-many that has you
                untagging yourself from photos the next day. SYB adventures offer
                workouts that will have you coming home looking fine as ever,
                experiences that you never imagined possible, and a community of
                people that love sweat-filled days and beer-filled nights just
                as much as you do. </p>
            <h2> What We Stand For </h2>
              <p> We are a company that is community-oriented, creating family
              in every paradise we venture to. SYB strives to create an environment
               that is meditative, open-minded, and bold. We focus on a balanced
              lifestyle of workin’ the bod during the day and twerkin’ the bod during
              the night. Surf allows us to appreciate this beautiful world of ours,
              yoga helps us remain present and thoughtful, and beer... because you know…
              it’s not the bottled water making us drop it low. </p>

              <p> Our adventures at SYB follow a simple mission: We detox to retox.
              This means we put value in bettering our bodies and minds while also
              enjoying the pleasures of life (beer). We go on excursions worldwide
              to escape the rat-race while working out, experiencing cultures different
              from our own, and making friendships with individuals of the same
              venturesome spirit. We work out to push ourselves past the barriers
              we build in our minds, we explore to appreciate the boundless experience
              of other cultures, and we drink beer to celebrate this vibrant life of ours. </p>
